This conference highlights current developments within and beyond
_Bioconductor_. Morning scientific talks and afternoon workshops
provide conference participants with insights and tools required for
the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data. 'Developer Day' precedes the main conference on June 24,
providing developers and would-be developers an opportunity to gain
insights into project direction and software development best
practices.

The conference will take place in two venues:
- Developer Day (June 24) at NYU Langone School of Medicine ([1st Avenue and East 30th Street](https://goo.gl/maps/WbtSVCpnrR92))
