## Call for Birds of a Feather / Special Interest Groups

We invite participants to form groups dedicated to discuss or work on
topics of interest. We will make rooms available for groups to meet
during the lunch breaks. We encourage students, postdocs and junior
faculty to participant and form groups.

To create a special interest group [open an issue][] describing the
topic. The issue title should start with SIG: followed by a short but
descriptive title. In the issue, include:

- An introduction of yourself.
- A description of the topic.
- Whether it should be held during Developer Day (Wednesday July 25)
  or the conference days (July 26-27).
- Desired outputs (could be code, a piece of documentation, or general
  discussion), and possible outcomes.

Interested participants should use the issue to ask questions and/or
express their interest in participating. Proposals with interest shown
by at least 3 additional participants by July 12 will be announced on
the conference web page, and will have a room reserved for their
meeting.
