## Local transportation

Toronto is a safe and walkable city, with many hotels within walking
distance of Victoria College.  Victoria College is also at the
intersection of subway lines, near both the north-south
Yonge-University line and the east-west Bloor line, making it fast to
arrive from anywhere along those subway lines.  It is near the Museum,
Bay, and Wellesley stops ([subway map][subway])

## Arriving by air

Toronto is served by two airports. Pearson International Airport (YYZ)
is the largest. It is served by the
[Union Pearson Express Train][train] which takes 25 minutes to arrive
downtown at Union Station where you can take a short subway or taxi
ride to any downtown hotel.  Otherwise, there is a flat fare of CDN$56
to take a taxi directly to/from Pearson Airport to the University of
Toronto downtown campus and surrounding hotels. Here is a
[full list][pearson] of transportation options to/from Pearson
Airport.

The downtown [Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport][billy] (YTZ) is
smaller and served only by propeller-driven flights from eastern
Canada and the U.S. (Boston, New York-Newark, Chicago,
Washington-Dulles). It's convenient if it serves where you are coming
from.
