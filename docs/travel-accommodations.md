- Main Conference and Robert Gentleman Symposium (June 25-27) at Rockefeller University 
([York Avenue and East 66th Street](https://goo.gl/maps/JkRcufXyhrq)).

## Accomodations

The conference venues are most easily accessible from the east side of Manhattan (especially around Grand Central Terminal) and from Long Island City (LIC). LIC provides good value for the price, but will require taking the subway (or a cablecar over the East River if you are near the bridge to Roosevelt Island!)
